# 📦 File Organizer Automation (Python)

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project is a Python automation script that organizes files from a source directory into categorized folders based on file extensions. It also generates structured logs for every file movement.

This simulates a real-world **data engineering batch processing task** where raw files are classified and moved into structured storage.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Practice filesystem automation using Python
- Use modern path handling with `pathlib`
- Implement production-style logging
- Build a reusable batch file processing utility
- Understand ETL-style thinking for file pipelines
